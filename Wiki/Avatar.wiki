[[Image:Icon-highlighted-avatar.png|left]]'''Avatars''' are the visual representation of players in [[Whirled]].  The default avatar for players is a piece of tofu.  Additional avatars can be created with the appropriate software or purchased with [[currency#Coins|coins]] or [[currency#Bars|bars]] in the [[shop]].  Some games, such as [[Brawler Whirled]], award avatars as prizes.

[[Image:Stuff-My Avatars.png|right|400px]]
When you have more than one avatar, you can change the avatar you are wearing.

# Go to the [[Stuff tab]] and select Avatars.
# Pick the avatar that you would like to use and click the the little happy face next to "Wear avatar."
# Close your inventory and you should be in the room using your newly selected avatar.

You can also change avatars by clicking on your avatar in a room and selecting "Change avatar..."  You can select from the five most recently used avatars, the default tofu avatar, or if you click on "View full list..." it will take you to the Avatars section of your Stuff.

If you want more than your default avatar, you can [[shop]] for one or [[create avatars|create]] your very own.  You can also buy a [[remixable item|remixable avatar]] and create one that way.

[[Image:Avatar-shift flying.png|left]]You can move your avatar around the room by clicking whenever your mouse shows a white outlined circle.  How much space there is to move avatars around in a room depends on the [[backdrop]].

You can go to other rooms by clicking on doorways, or objects that glow green when touched by your mouse cursor, in a room.  Or you can go to other rooms by clicking on their names on [[Profile]] pages or by entering Groups while browsing the [[Groups tab]].
