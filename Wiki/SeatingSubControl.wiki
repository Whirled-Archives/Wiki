The '''[http://www.whirled.com/code/asdocs/com/whirled/game/SeatingSubControl.html SeatingSubControl]''' 
is a subcontrol used by seated multiplayer [[game]]s to retrieve the status of the players in the seated game.

== Initialization ==

You should always access SeatingSubControl via the GameControl, don't try to instantiate the object directly.  

<actionscript>
public class MyGame extends Sprite {
    public MyGame () {
        _ctrl = new GameControl(this);

        //you can either access the SeatingSubControl via a handle
        //like this
        _seating = _ctrl.game.seating; 
        _myPos = _seating.getMyPosition(); 


        //or like this directly via the control object.
        _myPos = _ctrl.game.seating.getMyPosition();
        

    }

    protected _ctrl :GameControl;
    protected _seating : SeatingSubControl;
    protected _myPos: int; 
 
}
</actionscript>
