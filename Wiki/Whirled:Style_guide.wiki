Defer questions of style to [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Style and How-to Directory|Style and How-to Directory]].

== Article Names ==

Here are some guidelines for general pages:
*[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Naming conventions|Wikipedia's naming conventions]]
*[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Disambiguation|Wikipedia's disambiguation page]]

Since Whirled has various topics that require mixed case names, the Wikipedia guidelines will not always be appropriate.

== File Names ==

Uploaded files should be named clearly and plainly.  All images should have the appropriate [[Whirled:Image_tags|image tag]] included in the file description.  The preferred image format is PNG.  For images created by the Whirled community, please follow the following naming conventions:

*'''Game-''puzzlename''-''filename''''' - used for game images.
*'''Toy-''puzzlename''-''filename''''' - used for toy images.
*'''Tutorial-''tutorialname''-''filename''''' - used for images illustrating tutorials.

== Templates ==

=== Infoboxes ===
* {{tl|infobox game}} - For pages about games
* {{tl|infobox game (defunct)}} - For pages about games which are no longer available in Whirled, but were available at one point. (kept for historical purposes)
* {{tl|infobox toy}} - For pages about toys

=== Table of Contents ===
* {{tl|TOCright}} - For moving the TOC to the right
* {{tl|CompactTOC}} - For an ABC type TOC to replace the standard type.  Used for alphabetical lists.
