A game developer can [[Create and sell game packs#Showing the Shop During Game Play|open the game shop]] anytime during the game to upsell an item.

== Add Avatars, Backdrops, Toys, Pets, Images, Music and Videos to the Game Shop == 

# [[List]] your object in the shop.<br>[[Image:CorpseCraftStreetWalker.png|350px]]
# In the Edit Game->Extra tab of your game, create a "Shop Tag".  The tag can consist of letters, numbers and underscores.  In this case, we have added the Shop Tag of "corpsecraft" to the Corpse Craft game.<br>[[Image:CorpseCraftShopTag.png|350px]]
#In the shop details page of your item, add the same tag.<br>[[Image:CorpseCraftAvatarAddTag.png|350px]]
#Your object should now appear in your game shop.

'''In order for this to work, the lister of the avatar, backdrop, toy, pet, image, music or video must be the SAME as the lister of the game.'''
