[[Image:Block_in_chat.png|frame|right|You can get a menu of options by left clicking on a player's underlined name in chat.]]Players are able to '''chat''' with each other in various ways, sometimes dependent on their location. There are multiple modes of speaking, which affect how the text appears on screen. Each chat tab sends the message to a different group of people.

To chat, simply type your message into the chat input box on the bottom left corner of your room screen and click the Send button or hit enter.  The message will be sent to whichever chat tab you have selected.  If you send too many messages too quickly, you will get a message of: "You're being too chatty. Wait a moment and try again."

Clicking on a player's underlined name in chat will show a menu that includes [[block]] player, view their [[profile]], invite them to be your [[friend]], and [[report|complain]] about the user.

== Chat Tabs ==
[[Image:Chat tabs.png]]

There are two types of chat, private and group.  Each chat that you are currently viewing will be shown across the top of your screen under the the larger main tabs.  When a new, unviewed message has been sent in a chat, the tab will glimmer. The currently selected tab will be highlighted while the others will be darkened.  Click on a tab to select it.

When you close a Group chat tab, it will not reappear for the rest of your session unless you select it from Chat Options [[Image:Icon-chat options.png]] &rarr; Groups &rarr; <groupname>

== Chat Commands ==
Some commands can be run right from the chat window.  Typing /help will bring up a window with the most common commands.  Type /help <command> to get more information about the command or read about them in detail below.

=== /action ===
Sometimes you will find the need to trigger an action quickly, but you don't have enough time to click the avatar and click trigger action. The /action command triggers an action for your avatar, if it has any.  If there are no other actions that start with a j, instead of using "jump" you can just use "j".

Usage:<br>
<tt>/action <action> (/ac)</tt>

Results:<br>

=== /broadcast ===
[[Image:Broadcast-confirmation.png|300px|thumb|The broadcast confirmation window.|right]]
The /broadcast command sends a message to everyone currently logged into Whirled. Broadcasts cost [[currency#Bars|bars]] and the price increases if other broadcasts have recently been made.  You will get a confirmation popup with an option to add a link to your room or your party (if you are in one) that also has the bar price of your broadcast.  You will be able to click on the orange button with the bar cost to purchase the broadcast after you agree to the [[Terms of Service]].

If you are unable to broadcast, you have lost the privilege of being able to broadcast due to bad behavior. 

Usage:<br>
<tt>/broadcast <message></tt>
