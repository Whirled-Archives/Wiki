[[Image:Icon-remixable.png]] '''Remixable items''' are shop items with code that allows players to customize them in [[Whirled]] without having to do any coding or purchase [[Adobe Flash CS3]].

== Finding Remixable Items ==
Remixable items have the remixible icon ([[Image:Icon-remixable.png]]) in their information in the shop and in your inventory.

== Remixed Avatar & Reverting ==
If you have remixed an item that you purchased, you can save your remix.  Once you have successfully saved your remix, your avatar screen will look like this.  If you wish to revert the avatar to the original as seen in the store, click on the Revert button.  A popup will remind you that all your changes will be lost and you cannot undo reverting the avatar.
