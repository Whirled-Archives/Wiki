== Buying and Selling ==

You can also browse the "Music" category in the [[Shop]] and buy what you like. Currently, there is no way to listen to the tracks before buying them.

You can also [[list]] your music files for others to buy.

'''Note''': Most commercially distributed music comes with restrictive copyright licenses. Please do not list such songs unless you own the rights to them.

== Background Music in Rooms ==

You can add background music to rooms just like you add [[furniture]].

In the room, click the "Edit room" button, then "Add item" to bring up My Stuff from the Me tab. Select "Music", find the song you want, and click the little house icon that says "Add to room".

For now, only one song per room is possible. Jukeboxes and playlists are in development.
