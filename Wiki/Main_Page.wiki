'''Whirled''' is [[Three Rings]]' social virtual world of player-created content. Unleash your creativity through [[game]]s, [[avatar]]s, [[room]]s, music and more!  Whirled brings together creator and audience in a blend of communities that is rewarding both socially and economically. It's your Whirled! You can be anything you want by being an [[Portal:Artists|artist]], [[Portal:Creators|creator]], and/or [[Portal:Players|player]].

Whirled activity is based around social groups and the attention currency they produce and consume.  [[currency#Coins|Coins]] are generated by doing things like playing games with [[friend]]s, noodling about with your [[profile]] page, or uploading new content.  Purchasing content from the [[shop]] costs coins or [[currency#Bars|bars]], a cut of which goes to the creator of that content, and so on.  That's what makes the Whirled go 'round!
