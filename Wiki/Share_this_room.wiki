You can share your [[room]] by clicking on the '''Share or embed this place''' button ([[Image:Icon-share or embed.png]]).  The different options for sharing rooms are outlined below. ''Get a SWF'' is only available if you own the room or are a manager for the group that the room belongs to. Sharing Whirled also allows you to participate in the [[Affiliate Program]].

There is a different process for you to [[Embed#Avatars.2C_Backdrops.2C_Furniture.2C_Pets.2C_and_Toys|embed your creation]]s that are not rooms.

== Embed It ==
[[Image:Share_this_room-Embed_it.png|left|frame|This option gives you code to paste onto a website or blog that allows embedding code.]]Many blogs and websites allow you to embed code in your posts or pages.  If it doesn't work, make sure you are not using a WYSIWYG or "compose mode" editor and try again.  Some websites, such as Facebook and deviantART do not support this.  If you want to post on those websites, use the SWF method below.
