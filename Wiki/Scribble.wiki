'''Scribble''' is a fun Pictionary-like drawing game and world of collaborative art.

== Instructions ==

Scribble is a collection of drawing games. Currently, there are two game types: Wordsketch and Doodling.

=== Wordsketch ===

* Win coins by drawing pictures! When it's your turn, a secret word will appear for you to draw. The other players are trying to be the first one to guess your word!
* The sooner another player guesses your word, the more points you both get. Use the different colors and the eraser to convey your word quickly and carefully.
* Guess words that others are drawing by simply typing them into chat.

=== Doodling ===

* Freestyle drawing! Doodle on your friends or style your room just by drawing on it.
* Leave messages and drawings in other people's rooms, and create collaborative art with other players.

=== Thanks ===

A very special thanks to Silk, who did all of the trophy artwork. For game developers, the complete Scribble source code is available.
