'''[http://www.whirled.com/code/asdocs/com/whirled/game/NetSubControl.html NetSubControl]''' is a subcontrol, it provides a way for game clients to communicate shared state to each other and to server agents.  All games have access to an automatically shared state in the form of a hash table (also known as a mapping or associative array) that is synchronized among the game's players (clients), with notifications whenever a property is added or modified.

== Initialization ==

You should always access netSubControl via the gameControl, don't try to instantiate the object directly.  

<actionscript>
public class MyGame extends Sprite {
    public MyGame () {
        _ctrl = new GameControl(this);

        //you can either access the NetSubControl via a handle
        //like this
        _net = _ctrl.net; 
        _net.get("myProperty"); 


        //or like this directly via the control object.
        _ctrl.net.get("myProperty");
        

    }

    protected _ctrl :GameControl;
    protected _net : NetSubControl; 
}
</actionscript>

== Setting Properties ==

When you set a property it is immediately distributed to the other clients in the game. Reading a property is immediate, you are reading the properties that have already been distributed. When a client connects to an already-running game, any properties already set will be available.
