[[Image:Icon-room.png|left]]A '''room''' is a location in [[Whirled]] where player [[avatar]]s can walk around.  All rooms have [[backdrop]]s and room owners can edit the room to add items such as [[pet]]s, [[toy]]s, and [[furniture]].  

Rooms are linked to other rooms by [[door]]s.  Doors can be created from furniture by editing the room and selecting the furniture to be used as a door.  During this process, a new room can be created.  Currently new rooms cost {{roomcost}}. Rooms cannot be deleted at this time.

You can find a list of your rooms by going to the [[Me tab]] and clicking on the ''Rooms'' link.
