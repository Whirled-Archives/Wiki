The '''Game Developer Bonus Bling Pool''' is Whirled's way of rewarding game developers for creating awesome games!  

Each month Three Rings sets aside a pool of money, currently set at '''$10,000'''.  This pool is divided up each day according to hours of gameplay a game gets on Whirled.  So, the more popular your game is, the more [[currency#Bling|bling]] you can earn.  Your game must be integrated with the Whirled API and award coins in order for it to qualify for the Bling Pool.
