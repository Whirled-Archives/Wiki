To make a link to a location other than a room, for example, a place in the discussions or an external site on the internet, the instructions are very similar for making a door, except that you need to use the Make Link button in Decorate mode.

#Go to a room you already own.
#You will need a piece of [[furniture]] to turn into link furniture.  If you do not already have furniture in the current room that you wish to use as a door to the new room, follow these steps:
##Choose '''Stuff &rarr; Furniture'''.
##Check the '''Add to room''' box next to any item you want to add to the room.
#Click on the Room icon [[Image:Icon-room_control.png]] in the control bar and select the Decorate button [[Image:Icon-edit_room.png]].  If you added a piece of furniture to the room to use as link furniture, you will already be in Decorate mode.
#Choose the furniture that you wish to turn into link furniture by clicking it in the room.
#In the Decorate panel, there is a door icon labeled "Make Link."  Click on it.
#A popup window will appear with two text areas.  The first if for your link starting with http:// and the second is for the tooltip text that will show up when you mouse over the link furniture.<br>[[Image:Decorating room-New website link.png]]
#Click on the "OK" button and your furniture will be linked.

== Undoing Links ==

#Click on the Room icon [[Image:Icon-room_control.png]] in the control bar and select the Decorate Room button [[Image:Icon-edit_room.png]] to get into furniture arranging mode.
#Choose the link furniture that you wish to undo by clicking it in the room.
#Click on the "Drop Link" button in the Decorating Room window and your furniture will be a normal, non-linked piece of furniture again.
