This is part of the [[Setting up your programming environment]] tutorial.

== Download/Test the SDK ==

Download the latest [[Whirled SDK]].

Unzip the SDK you downloaded in your chosen directory.  This should create a '''whirled''' directory with a few subdirectories.

In Windows:

 C:\whirled>dir /w
  Volume in drive C has no label.
  Volume Serial Number is XXXX-XXXX
 
  Directory of C:\whirled
 
 [.]              [..]             build.xml        [contrib]
 [dist]           [docs]           [etc]            [examples]
 fatserver.bat    [lib]            newproject.bat   README.html
 [src]            [templates]
                4 File(s)          4,036 bytes
               10 Dir(s)  XXX bytes free

In UNIX:
  robert@localhost:~/code$ unzip whirled_sdk.zip 
  [ files... ]
  robert@localhost:~/code$ ls whirled
  README.html	dist		examples	newproject.bat
  build.xml	docs		fatserver.bat	src
  contrib	etc		lib		templates

== Run One of the Example Games ==

Now that you have your SDK all set up, you can make sure everything is working by running one of the example games.

=== Windows ===
Navigate to the '''whirled\examples\games\reversi''' folder and double click the '''build.bat''' file to build and run the sample game.

=== Unix and Mac OS X ===
Build and run the game from the command line:
  robert@localhost:~/code$ cd whirled/examples/games/reversi
  robert@localhost:reversi$ ant -Dplayers=2 test

== Configuration ==
When you run the example game reversi, it will ask you to configure the location of Flex SDK and the standalone Flash player.

=== Configure SDK Location ===
This will first pop up a dialog asking you to tell the Whirled SDK where to find your '''flex_sdk_3''' directory.  It really means whatever the current Flex SDK version is (currently 3.3).

|-
|valign="top"|[[Image:FlexSDK Location.png|350px|none|thumb|Click on OK and you will be able to browse to the correct location.]]
|valign="top"|[[Image:FlexSDK_dir.png|350px|none|thumb|Select the directory where your flex SDK 3 is installed, likely it's flex_sdk_3.3 in some directory. Navigate to the directory and click on the OK button.]]
|}
After you have configured this once, you will not need to do it again.

=== Configure Standalone Player Location ===
On Linux and Windows platforms, you will have to select the location of your debug flash player executable.  Note you will not have to do this for a Mac installation.
{|
|-
|valign="top"|[[Image:Need player info.png|350px|none|thumb|Click on OK and you will be able to browse to the correct location.]]
|valign="top"|[[Image:Need player chooser.png|350px|none|thumb|In most cases, this was installed when you installed the Flex SDK.  Browse to the location of your Flex SDK install and look for flex_sdk_3.3/runtimes/player/ then select the directory with your OS name (win, lnx, mac, 10). Select the FlashPlayer and click on the OK button.]]
|}
After you have configured this once, you will not need to do it again.

=== Compile and Run the Game ===
You should then see it compile the game, then run a test server.  In Windows, two Flash player popups will display the game client (representing the two players in reversi - black & white).  In Linux and Mac, a single Flash player popup will display the game client with two tabs.

If you see the game client then everything is fully operational. Otherwise look at the output on the command line for any error messages which might indicate that something is misconfigured.
