Every object in Flash has the "stage" property set. 

Due to security reasons, the Whirled platform does not allow full access to the stage. Currently, the platform does not allow you to do the following to the stage:

* Add listeners
* Check stageWidth, stageHeight
* If the object that currently has the focus is in an inaccessible security boundary it will look like null to you.
