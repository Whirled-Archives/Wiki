[[Image:Icon-highlighted-avatar.png|left]] Whirled avatars are animated characters that represent the personality, mood or style of the owner to the Whirled at large.  Custom avatars are easy to make with the right tools, and let you create a truly unique appearance for yourself, or sell your creations to the eager masses.  Follow the tutorials below for both step-by-step guides to the basics of avatar creation and helpful techniques for more advanced creators. Some avatars have "actions" and "states" that make chatting more fun!

== Getting Started ==
The simplest way to make your own unique avatar is to buy a [[remixable items|remixable avatar]].  If you want to try your hand at some programming, you can make Avatars either in  [[Adobe Flash CS3]] or in standalone [[AS3]].

===[[Image:Icon-Flash.png]]  Adobe Flash CS3===
[[Adobe Flash CS3]] is the tool our art department uses to make avatars.  You can work from our pre-coded templates or create entire avatars from scratch. ([http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/ Adobe's Flash page])

===[[Image:Icon-Programming.png]] AS3===

Standalone [[AS3]] is targeted more at programmers.  But don't be scared, just follow our tutorial! (A major plus of AS3 is that it's FREE!)

== Code Examples ==
Learning by example is the easiest way, so make sure to check out our many game examples on our [http://code.threerings.net/viewvc/whirled/trunk/projects/avatars/ SVN server].  Some of these are created in [[Adobe Flash CS3]] and some of these are created with standalone [[AS3]].
