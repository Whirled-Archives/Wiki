{{TOCright}}
[[Image:Icon-highlighted-game.png|left]]Whirled games are developed in ActionScript 3 (AS3) either using the standalone compiler or the Flash 9 Authoring Tool. This documentation assumes a working knowledge of these technologies, but resources are listed below to learn more about Flash and ActionScript.

== Code Examples ==
Learning by example is the easiest way, so make sure to check out our many game examples on our [http://code.threerings.net/viewvc/whirled/trunk/projects/games/ SVN server].  Please note that in order to reduce the size of the SDK download, some of our bigger games, such as [http://dpw.threerings.net/viewvc/underwhirleddrift/ UnderWhirledDrift] and [http://dpw.threerings.net/viewvc/defense/ treehouse defense], sit under a different directory.

Note that while Whirled uses the free Flex SDK and the optional Flex Builder as an IDE, Whirled does not support Flex components or MXML.

== Writing a Server class for your game ==

Starting with SDK 0.33, Whirled supports the running of ActionScript [[server agent]]s for your game. This is more complex to code, but benefits include:
* Consolidation of logic for multi-player games
* Lower latency
* More robust in the face of unreliable browsers

You can follow [[Multiplayer server based game (ActionScript tutorial)|this tutorial]] to make your first server based game.

== AVR games ==
{{main|AVR game}}
AVRGs are games that take place in Whirled rooms.
