You can use AS3 both as standalone, or inside [[Adobe Flash CS3]].  You can learn more about it [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/articles/actionscript3_overview.html here].

Here are some examples of what AS3 looks like 

<actionscript>
   protected function handleEnterFrame (... ignored) :void
    {
        var now :Number = getTimer();
        var elapsed :Number = now - _bounceBase;
        while (elapsed > BOUNCE_FREQUENCY) {
            elapsed -= BOUNCE_FREQUENCY;
            _bounceBase += BOUNCE_FREQUENCY; // give us less math to do next time..
        }

        var val :Number = elapsed * Math.PI / BOUNCE_FREQUENCY;
        _image.y = BOUNCE - (Math.sin(val) * BOUNCE);
    }

</actionscript>

Files with just stand alone AS3 will usually be called *.as files before you compile them, while AS3 being used in [[Adobe Flash CS3]] are usually part of the *.fla file.  Both of these will compile to *.swf.
