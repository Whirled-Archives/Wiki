[[Image:Icon-Flash.png|left]]'''Adobe Flash CS3''' is the Adobe's Flash development environment. The program is not free, but there is a 30-day free trial and students & teachers may qualify for education pricing.  You can learn more about it on [http://www.adobe.com/products/flash Adobe's site]. Note that this is just a development environment, you can use Adobe Flash CS3 and still use [[AS3]] code.  You will also see it occasionally referred to as FAT, which stands for Flash Authoring Tool.

Files you create in Adobe Flash CS3 will mostly be called *.fla before you compile them and *.swf after you compile them.
