== Finding and Inviting Players to be your Friend ==
[[Image:Invite to be your friend.png|left|frame|You can click on the avatar of someone in the same room to invite them to be your friend.]]
If you already know someone that has a [[Whirled]] account or you think someone you know has one, you can try searching for their profile in the friends section of the Me tab by using their permaname, email address, Whirled name, or real name.  Then click on "Add as Friend" and a popup will let you customize the message they receive from you.

If you don't know anyone that plays Whirled, you can search for people with the same interests as you and invite them to be your friend by clicking on "Add as Friend."  Also, you can meet other players in [[Edit your room|room]]s, through discussions in [[Group]]s, and by playing [[game]]s with others.  When you find a new friend this way, either look up their profile or click on their [[avatar]] and select "Invite to be your friend."  Adding a friend by the avatar clicking route does not allow you to customize your message and you simply get a notice that "Your friend request was successfully mailed."  The default mail text is "Let's be buddies!"

When your friend request is accepted, that person will be listed on your profile as a friend and you will be listed on their profile as a friend.  Being friends also makes it easier for you to invite each other to play multiplayer games together and find & join them in a room when they are online.

=== Step by Step Instructions on Adding Friends ===

# '''Choose ''Me &rarr; Friends''''' to start connecting up with your friends.
# Type in a friend's real name, email address or Whirled (display) name and '''click Search''' to find their Profile. ''Hint: If you play other games such as [[Puzzle Pirates]] or [[Bang! Howdy]], you may find that friends from those games have used the same name in Whirled.''
# '''Click on their name''' to view their profile page.
# Click '''Send Mail''' to send them a mail in Whirled or click '''Invite to be Your Friend''' to add them to your Friends list.
# It's easy to meet ''new'' people in Whirled too, especially with Groups. '''Choose ''Groups''''' to see the wide range of friendly Whirled communities. [[Group]]s which currently contain other players may be found and entered by scrolling through "Featured Groups" under the Groups tab.

=== Batch Friend Requests ===
After hanging out in a room or playing a game, you may be asked if you want to befriend the people you were with.
